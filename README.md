Bike Buyers Data Analysis Project

Overview:

In this project, I analyzed a dataset related to bike buyers, focusing on data cleaning, visualization, and interactive reporting. The project showcases my ability to process and present data in a clear and actionable manner.

Data Cleaning:

- Filtering and Removing Duplicates: I ensured the dataset's integrity by removing any duplicate entries and filtering out irrelevant data to maintain a high level of accuracy.

- Trimming Spaces: I cleaned the data by trimming unnecessary spaces from text fields, which improved data consistency and quality.

- Substituting Values: I standardized the dataset by substituting incorrect or missing values, ensuring that the data was uniform and ready for analysis.

Data Analysis:

- Pivot Tables: I utilized pivot tables to efficiently summarize and analyze the data, enabling a deeper understanding of patterns and trends within the dataset.

 Data Visualization:

- Charts and Graphs: Leveraging the summarized data from the pivot tables, I created various charts and graphs that provided clear visual insights into the behavior of bike buyers.

- Interactive Slicing: To enhance user engagement, I implemented slicing techniques, making the visualizations interactive and allowing users to explore the data from multiple angles.

Reporting:

- Visualization Dashboard: I compiled all the charts and graphs into a dedicated sheet, creating a comprehensive dashboard that serves as an intuitive reporting tool.
